A bank deposit is a financial deposit maintained by a bank for a customer. A bank deposit can be a deposit deposit, a credit card deposit, a current deposit, or any other type of deposit offered by a financial institution, and represents the funds that a customer has entrusted to the financial institution and from which the customer can make withdrawals. Alternatively, deposits may be loan deposits in which case the customer owes money to the financial institution.The financial transactions which have occurred within a given period of time on a bank deposit are reported to the customer on a bank statement and the balance of the deposits at any point in time is the financial position of the customer with the institution.The laws of each and every country specify the manner in which deposits may be opened and operated. They may specify, for example, who may open an deposit, how the signatories can identify themselves, deposit and withdrawal limits and many other matters.
