deposit is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context. The main functions of deposit are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.[4][5] Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as deposit.
deposit is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity deposit, but nearly all contemporary deposit systems are based on fiat deposit. Fiat deposit, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity. It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private".The deposit supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank deposit (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). Bank deposit, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad deposit in developed countries.
